# Data Structure Course:
In this project I am going to write codes about things that 
I learn in [this course](https://maktabkhooneh.org/course/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%87-%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%AE%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%88-%D9%85%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%86%DB%8C-%D8%A7%D9%84%DA%AF%D9%88%D8%B1%DB%8C%D8%AA%D9%85-%D9%87%D8%A7-mk376/).
You can find the pamphlets, exercises and exams of the course in [this link](https://github.com/asharifiz/DS_Jupyter.git).

For each concept, I am going to pause the video and start to code by myself. 
After that, I check my code with the professor,
then try to optimize my code until I get the best form.

I am going to do the same for Exercises and Exams of this course.

Wish me luck!
